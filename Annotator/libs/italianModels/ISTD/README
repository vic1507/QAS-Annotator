This is the readme file for the downloaded training and development
sets of the Dependency Parsing for Information Extraction (DPIE)
Shared Task of Evalita 2014.

Table of contents:
1. Training data 
2. Development data
3. Data format

1. Training data

The training data consists of 165,845 tokens (7,398 sentences) from
the "Italian Stanford Dependency Treebank" (file isdt_train.conll).
ISDT derives from the merging and harmonization of two existing
resources for the Italian language, i.e. the Turin University Treebank
(TUT) and the ISST-TANL Treebank.

2. Development data

The development data consists of 12,703 tokens extracted from the same
resource (file isdt_devel.conll).

3. Data format

- Data format adheres to the standard CoNLL format
  
- Data files contain sentences separated by a blank line. A sentence
  consists of one or more tokens, each one starting on a new line. For
  each token the following information is provided: id, word form,
  lemma, coarse grained part-of-speech, fine grained part-of-speech,
  morpho-syntactic features, the id of its governing head, the
  dependency relation holding between the two

- The part-of-speech and dependency tagsets are described at the following address:
